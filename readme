Now install the Python extension on VScode then reboot software. Once software posts run python --version in the terminal. If it says Python 3.13.2 it is working.

3. Install Required Libraries:
You'll need three libraries for your code:

pip within the terminal (python get-pip.py)
requests (for making HTTP requests)
pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)
json (comes with Python)
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command in your VScode terminal:
pip install requests pyttsx3 (run this within VScode terminal)

For speech to speech, you will need also to install...

Speech_recognition (pip install SpeechRecognition)
PyAudio (pip install pyaudio)
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command in your VScode terminal:
pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio

Now it should work!
