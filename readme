Must install...
1. Latest Python Version 
Make sure to check the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. Install Required Libraries:
You'll need three libraries for your code:

requests (for making HTTP requests)
pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)
json (comes with Python, so no need to install it separately)
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
pip install requests pyttsx3

3. setup ollama API locally
For this to work, you need to have the Ollama service running locally at http://localhost:11434
